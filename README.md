# Virtual Assistant

A Python-based virtual assistant that interacts with users through voice commands and performs a variety of tasks such as responding to queries, automating tasks, and retrieving information from the web. The assistant utilizes **Pyttsx** for text-to-speech conversion, along with other Python libraries for voice recognition and task execution.

## Features

- **Voice Interaction**: The virtual assistant listens to the user's voice commands and responds verbally.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Uses **Pyttsx** for clear and natural voice synthesis.
- **Task Automation**: Automates tasks such as opening applications, searching the web, and performing calculations.
- **Information Retrieval**: Capable of fetching information from the web, such as news, weather, and more.
- **Extensible**: Easily customizable to add new commands and functionalities.

## Requirements

To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:

- `pyttsx3` - For text-to-speech conversion.
- `SpeechRecognition` - For recognizing voice commands.
- `webbrowser` - For automating web tasks.
- `os` - To interact with the operating system for task automation.
- `datetime` - To fetch and respond with the current time and date.
- `wikipedia` - To fetch and summarize data from Wikipedia.

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition wikipedia
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x recommended).
3. Install the required libraries (as mentioned above).
4. Run the main Python script:

```bash
python virtual_assistant.py
```

5. Speak into your microphone when prompted, and the assistant will respond accordingly.

## Usage

Some example voice commands you can use with the virtual assistant:

- **"What is the time?"** – The assistant will tell you the current time.
- **"Open Google"** – The assistant will open Google in the browser.
- **"Tell me about Python"** – The assistant will fetch information from Wikipedia.
- **"Search for weather"** – The assistant will perform a web search for the current weather.

## Customization

You can easily add new commands by editing the `virtual_assistant.py` file. Simply define new functions for the assistant to perform and link them to voice commands in the command recognition section.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pyttsx3** for voice synthesis
- **SpeechRecognition** for processing voice commands
- **Wikipedia API** for fetching information
- **Webbrowser** and **OS** modules for automating tasks
